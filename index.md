Research Scientist at Meta. 

My research focuses on **efficient and trustworthy machine learning**, aiming to make AI models more accessible and beneficial to the general public. Recently, I have been exploring the safety and reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs), including defenses against prompt injection attacks, protection strategies, and methods to identify, mitigate, and even leverage implicit biases within these systems.

I studied my PhD under the supervision of [Prof. Mario Fritz](https://cispa.saarland/group/fritz/) at [CISPA](https://cispa.de/en), Germany. Before joining CISPA, I was a research intern at the [Max-Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home), Germany, and received my Master's degree under the supervision of [Prof. Wen-Hsiao Peng](https://sites.google.com/g2.nctu.edu.tw/wpeng) and [Prof. Wei-Chen Chiu](https://walonchiu.github.io/) in [National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University](https://www.nycu.edu.tw/nycu/en/index), Taiwan.
