<h2 style="margin: 80px 0px 10px;"></h2>

I am a final-year Ph.D. student under the supervision of [Prof. Mario Fritz](https://cispa.saarland/group/fritz/) at [CISPA](https://cispa.de/en), Germany. My research focuses on **efficient and privacy-preserving machine learning**, with the goal of making AI models more accessible to the general public. Specifically, my work involves **privacy-preserving federated learning**, **domain adaptation**, and adapting generative models, such as **large language models (LLMs)**, to new tasks. My work has received over 400 citations according to Google Scholar. <span class='show_paper_citations' data='UAnfs8UAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC'></span>

Before joining CISPA, I was a reserch internship in [Max-Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home), Germany, and received my Master degree under the supervision of [Prof. Wen-Hsiao Peng](https://sites.google.com/g2.nctu.edu.tw/wpeng) and [Prof. Wei-Chen Chiu](https://walonchiu.github.io/) in [National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University](https://www.nycu.edu.tw/nycu/en/index), Taiwan.
